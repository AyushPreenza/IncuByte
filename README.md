Incubyte assignment

-> This project uses BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) to structure test cases and both BDD and POM(Page Object Model) for test scripts.

-> This script is creating new user with random email and password then using same credentials for logging in again


-> I have also configured extent report, you can watch report after every execution in Reports folder, In case of failure you can see screenshot where it got failed


-> DriverUtil class contains the code for initializing the webdriver for any browser you want to run the tests (But i prefer chrome).


-> This framework also contains the config.properties and config reader code but i didnt use it in the script.
